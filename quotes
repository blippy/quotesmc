Don't think that only sitting with the eyes closed is practice. If you
do think this way, then quickly change your thinking. Steady practice
is keeping mindful in every posture, whether sitting, walking,
standing or lying down. When coming out of sitting, don't think that
you're coming out of meditation, but that you are only changing
postures. If you reflect in this way, you will have peace. Wherever
you are, you will have this attitude of practice with you constantly.
You will have a steady awareness within yourself.

1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 2
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is
vanity. 3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh
under the sun? 4 One generation passeth away, and another generation
cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. 5 The sun also ariseth, and
the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. 6 The
wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it
whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to
his circuits. 7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not
full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
again. 8 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye
is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 9 The
thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is
done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the
sun. 10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
it hath been already of old time, which was before us. 11 There is no
remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance
of things that are to come with those that shall come after.
