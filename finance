"It is the long term investor, he who most promotes the public
interest, who will in practice come in for the most criticism,
wherever investment funds are managed by committees or boards or
banks. For it is in the essence of his behaviour that he should be
eccentric, unconventional and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If
he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his
rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful, which is very
likely, he will not receive much mercy. Worldly wisdom teaches that it
is better for reputations to fail conventionally than succeed
unconventionally."  -- John Maynard Keynes

I conceptualize the situation as a simple 2-by-2 matrix:
Of course it?s not easy and clear-cut, but I think that?s the general situation. If your behavior and
that of your managers is conventional, you?re likely to get conventional results ? either good or
bad. Only if the behavior is unconventional is your performance likely to be
unconventional . . . and only if the judgments are superior is your performance likely to be
above average.
Contrarian investing, which is akin to unconventional investing, has been behind many of the
greatest successes. But that?s not the same as saying all contrarian decisions are successful. As
is the case with unconventionality, you should not aim for contrarianism for its own sake, but
only when the reasons are good and the actions of the crowd look particularly foolish. If your
actions aren?t founded on solid logic, (a) they?re unlikely to work consistently, and (b) when the
going gets tough, you might find it hard to hold on through the lows. David Swensen puts it well
in his book, ?Pioneering Portfolio Management?:
Contrarian, long-term investing poses extraordinary challenges under the best of
circumstances. . . . Unfortunately, overcoming the tendency to follow the crowd,
while necessary, proves insufficient to guarantee investment success. . . . While
courage to take a different path enhances chances for success, investors face
likely failure unless a thoughtful set of investment principles undergirds the
courage.

It Can?t Miss ? The fact is, anything can miss. There?s no asset so

investment technique is guaranteed to deliver high returns or keep

high return and low risk to persist ? good results bring in buyers who
raise prices, lowering future returns and elevating risk. It?ll never
